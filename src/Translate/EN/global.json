    "question-3": "How does the flat-rate system work?",
    "answer-3": "The traditional financing method for healthcare is the fee-for-service system. This system involves paying the healthcare provider and then being partially reimbursed by the health insurance company.",

      "c-st-1": "In case of supply shortages, pharmacists will be required to dispense medications in single doses. This measure was taken to avoid stock shortages experienced last winter. Pharmacies will need to provide the appropriate quantity to patients and prevent unfinished tablets from expiring in our cabinets.",
      "st-2": "Over-the-Counter Antibiotics",
      "c-st-2": "Another novelty in pharmacies. In case of sore throats or cystitis, pharmacists will be able to dispense antibiotics, which were previously only available by prescription. They will need to conduct a preliminary test (TROD) to ensure that there is indeed a bacterial origin. This expansion of competencies aims to address the difficulty for French people to find a doctor. However, it is contested by many doctors who consider it a 'quick fix' (cystitis sometimes requires a clinical examination), as it is a way to 'circumvent' the problem (the difficulty of recruiting practitioners) at the expense of the quality of care.",

      "c-st-4": "To combat the increase in expenses related to sick leave, the government has limited to three days the duration of sick leave prescribed by teleconsultation (unless it is your attending physician). It had gone even further in its approach by allowing the company's appointed medical controller to suspend the payment of allowances if the leave was deemed unjustified, but the Constitutional Council fortunately censored this measure, considered by several general practitioner unions as an 'unacceptable monitoring'. By making the employer both judge and 'party', it struck a blow to one of the basic principles of our public health, solidarity (anyone unable to work due to their physical or mental condition has the right to obtain suitable means of existence from the community). And in a context of physician shortage, it is clear that organizing counter-visits is clearly not appreciated...",

      "c-st-6": "Let's talk about expenses now! The Social Security system also plans to allocate part of its budget to prevention (very useful when it comes to long-term savings). After male condoms last year, it's finally time for female condoms to be provided free of charge. They will be fully covered by Social Security for those under 26 starting January 1. This measure is part of a strategy to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.",

      "content": "Since the discovery of fire in prehistoric times, humans have developed various methods of cooking their food. But what is the benefit of heating food before eating it? Cooking food makes it more digestible and easier to chew (1). Raw, some foods contain antinutritional factors that cooking will destroy. For example, Dr. Juliette Pouyat explains in the guide 'The Right Choice for Cooking,' 'the starch in pasta or rice becomes digestible after boiling in water, thanks to a modification of its structure that is more favorable to the action of amylase, which breaks down starch into glucose molecules.' The temperature also denatures proteins, unfolding their structure and facilitating the action of digestive enzymes. We also cook food to make them edible, destroy harmful microorganisms, and preserve them better. Cooking also produces pleasant aromas that come from chemical reactions grouped under the name Maillard reaction. But this reaction has a double-edged sword: it leads to flavors highly appreciated by consumers, but the molecules involved are suspected to promote the development of certain cancers or inflammatory reactions. However, cooking can lead to a degradation of the nutritional quality of the food, with a loss of vitamins denatured by heat, and the appearance of undesirable compounds. For healthy cooking, the benefits of steam cooking are often praised.",
